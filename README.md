# PJAZZ

Pronouned: [puh-jaz]

## What is it?

A really simple lightweight SPA library for faking your way to greatness. No, really. It just grabs the pages at the other end of the link and replaces the current body tags with
the content from the target page. That's it.

## Why?

There are other libraries out there that do the same thing (PJAX) but I wanted something even lighter that would be super simple to install and get going with.

## Notes

Watch this spaceâ€¦

### Thanks

I spent an age trying to find a vanilla method for jQuery's native parseHTML() until I found the fantastic resource [YouMightNotNeedJquery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) which suggested using a temporary html node in memory which could then be traversed like a traditional node tree.
